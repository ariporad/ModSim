% Calculate the elevation of the sun from the horizon
% `seconds` should be the number of seconds since the start of the year (00:00:00 on Jan 1). 
% `utc_offset` should be a positive or negative integer of hours (ex. -5 for EST, -9 for PDT).
%
% NOTE: this function is fundementally an approximation, and so will be somewhat inaccurate. For
%       most circumstances (ex. not in the artic circle), I think it won't be too inacurate (Â±~5deg)
%
% PROTIP: here are reasonable values for the paramaters:
%	- `seconds`: generally a large number between 10^5 and 10^8
%	- `lat`:  -180 to 180, generally between ~-70 and ~-125 (NB: negative) for the continential US.
%	- `long`: -180 to 180, generally between ~25 and ~45 (NB: positive) for the continential US.
%	- `utc_offset`: with a few exceptions, integers -12 to +12. -9 to -5 for the continential US.

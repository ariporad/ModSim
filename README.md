# ModSim

All my coursework from Olin's [Modeling and Simulation of the Physical World](https://olin.smartcatalogiq.com/2020-21/Catalog/Courses-Credits-Hours/MTH-Mathematics/1000/MTH1111), which is a class that all Olin students take in their first semester. As the name implies, it covers modeling and simulating the physical world, mostly through iterative and ODE-based models in MATLAB.
